            <p className={styles.subtitle}>Senior Software Engineer</p>
            <p>
              I am a senior-level software engineer with over 13 years of
              professional experience in full-stack development of web and
              mobile apps, and development team leadership.
            </p>

            <p>
              My current focuses include <strong>React</strong> front-ends (web
              and native), <strong>Node.js</strong> APIs, and{" "}
              <strong>Wordpress</strong> custom themes and plugins. I have a
              lifelong passion for writing thoughtful, readable, and practical
              code, and my skill set continuously grows and adapts to the
              current tech trends and standards.
            </p>

            <p>
              As someone who has been a part of the industry’s evolution over
              the last two decades, my experience with the complete software
              development lifecycle has led me to be an effective{" "}
              <strong>team leader</strong> and <strong>coding mentor</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also specialize in <strong>user experience</strong>. Creating
              successful applications is more than just writing code—an
              understanding of user expectations, an eye for good design, and
              collaboration with the design and UX teams are all essential to
              creating apps that are both beautiful and functional.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a freelancer, I am always looking for new projects of any size.
              If you think I would be a good fit for your project, please
              contact me.

            <p>
              As a contract software engineer, I support existing software
              development teams in architecting, developing, maintaining, and
              deploying their projects. I also help define and develop projects
              from scratch for businesses looking to create web and mobile apps
              that support their businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              My experience with the clients that Surge has paired me with have
              allowed me to work in different industries including insurance
              underwriting, police investigations, stock market analysis,
              medical provider evaluation, social networking, and many others.
              This has not only expanded my technological expertise, but also my
              ability to adapt to different business models and incorporate
              business logic for a wide array of client needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              This job is entirely remote, which has required a high degree of
              self-motivation, discipline, and communication skills in order to
              ensure projects are delivered on time and that critical issues are
              resolved in a timely manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              The technologies I have used vary widely between clients. These
              include React (web and native), Angular, Node.js, SQL, mongodb,
              and Wordpress (php).
